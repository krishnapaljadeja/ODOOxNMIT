## 🎯 Post-Analysis Action Plan

**After completing your frontend audit (Task 0.1-0.3), create your custom plan:**

### My Custom Integration Priority List:

1. [x] **Task 1.1-1.4: API Infrastructure Setup** (Highest Priority)
   - Set up axios, environment config, and auth token management
   - Foundation for all other integrations
2. [ ] **Task 2.1-2.3: Authentication Integration** (High Priority)
   - Connect existing login/signup forms to backend
   - Replace mock auth with real JWT token management
3. [ ] **Task 3.1-3.2: Product Listing & Creation** (High Priority)
   - Replace mock product data with API calls
   - Connect add-product form to backend
4. [ ] **Task 5.1-5.2: Cart Integration** (Medium Priority)
   - Connect cart functionality to backend APIs
   - Maintain existing cart UX with real data
5. [ ] **Task 4.1-4.2: Search & Filtering** (Medium Priority)
   - Connect existing search/filter UI to backend
   - Preserve current filtering UX

### My Specific Challenges:

- **Challenge 1**: Existing components use mock data extensively
  - **Solution**: Create API service layer to replace mock calls while preserving component interfaces
- **Challenge 2**: Current auth context uses localStorage with mock data
  - **Solution**: Enhance existing auth context to use real JWT tokens and API calls
- **Challenge 3**: Forms have client-side validation but no API error handling
  - **Solution**: Add API error handling to existing form validation patterns
- **Challenge 4**: Cart state management is complex with localStorage persistence
  - **Solution**: Integrate backend cart APIs while maintaining existing cart UX and state management
